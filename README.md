# Odot
A simple working todo list made with Ruby on Rails to help learn the framework.

This was my first Ruby on Rails project. The focus was more on learning the Rails scaffolding than styling the layouts. I used a TDD (Test-Driven Development) methodology for this project. So, there are tests for everything in their appropriate specs directory and file.

## Usage ##
To see this project in action, in the root directory of the project, run:

    bin/rails server

Then, you should be able to see the finished "user-facing" product at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Future Considerations ##
Possibly turn this into a turn-key solution for any and all TODO lists out there in the wild.
